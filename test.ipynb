IT risk assessment helps to determine the vulnerabilities in information systems \\nand the broader IT environment, assess the likelihood that a risky event will occur, \\nand rank risks based on the risk estimate combined with the level of impact that it \\nwould cause if it occurs.  It will also help in identifying controls and measures \\nrequired to be included in IT policies and Standard Operating Procedures  (SOP) .  \\n \\n2. The concept of risk is a key consideration in policy making. A well \\nwritten  Organization level IT policy, procedure and manual  reduces operating \\ncosts and improves performance by enhancing consistency and establishing clear \\ncriteria for computer, network, hardware, software, information security, and IT \\nvendor management. Establishing consistent IT SOP best practices an d \\noperational methods are an important component in safeguarding information \\nsystems, IT assets, and IT investments.  \\n \\n3. SEBI intends to conduct risk assessment, prepare policy documents, standard \\noperating procedures (SOPs), documentation of procedures and p rocesses and \\nother IT documents through consultation. SEBI also requires design specification \\ndocument to be prepared for all the selected processes  for automation . \\n \\n4. SEBI has certain policy documents in place which might require variations as per \\nthe best industry standards and practices.  \\n \\n5.

One extract, in particular, stands out to me: \\n“New occasions teach new duties;\\nTime makes ancient good uncouth;\\nThey must ward still, and onward,\\nwho would keep abreast of Truth.”\\nAlthough Lowell’s words were penned in a different historical and cultural context from contemporary 21\\nst \\ncentury life, I cannot help but reflect on their pertinence for the global effort to create a more sustainable future. \\nThe latest Intergovernmental Panel on \\nClimate Change (IPCC) report warns that climate change of 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming is already causing widespread disruption in every region of the world. Unless we take swift and decisive action to tackle climate change, the world will suffer from increasingly severe impacts including drought, extreme heat, and sea level rise. Consequently, human society will also suffer from compromised food, water, and energy security. New occasions teach new duties\\nHowever, the IPCC report also sets out the immense capacity that we have to bring to bear to protect current and future generations from harm – policy, infrastructure, and technology interventions could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 70% by 2050. \\nFinance, in particular, is a powerful tool \\nfor tackling the climate crisis. However, tracked financial flows remain up to six times less than the levels needed to achieve climate mitigation goals across all sectors and regions; and up to ten times less in the case of adaptation finance. \\nSustainable finance activity has \\naccelerated significantly in Singapore and the region. Singapore is now ASEAN’s largest sustainable finance market, accounting for close to 50% of cumulative ASEAN green and sustainability-linked bond and loan issuances. From 2018 to 2021, over S$39.8 billion of green and sustainability-linked loans have been issued in Singapore. Notably, sustainability-linked loans experienced continued sustained growth with a quadrupling of volumes from 2019 levels.\\nMAS has made good progress on \\nsustainability initiatives in its physical operations, reserves management, financial supervision, and development of the financial sector.\\nTo reduce our organisational carbon and \\nenvironmental footprint, we developed a framework to reduce emissions from business air travel and embarked on measures to further reduce our upstream and downstream emissions from currency operations.\\nTo develop a climate-resilient \\ninvestment portfolio, we are taking targeted portfolio actions to manage transition risks in the near-term. We will continue in our efforts to assess and manage the impact of climate risks on long-term returns, guided by medium-term signposts on the transition pathways and associated climate change impacts. \\nTo strengthen the financial sector’s \\nresilience against environmental risks, we conducted thematic reviews of financial institutions’ progress in implementing the Environmental Risk Management Guidelines, and issued information papers to share key observations and progressive industry practices. We have also supported international sustainability reporting efforts.\\nTo develop a vibrant green finance \\necosystem, we have intensified efforts to be a regional knowledge and talent hub for sustainable finance by anchoring a third Centre of Excellence and setting out Sustainable Finance Technical Skills and Competencies. We also launched pilot programmes for the ESG Disclosure Platform and ESG Registry under Project Greenprint, to catalyse sustainability data flows between the real economy and the financial sector.\\nIn this year’s Sustainability Report, \\nMAS has introduced and enhanced new quantitative metrics and targets to further align with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), including: \\n•\\t2030\\t targets\\tfor\\tScope\\t1,\\tScope\\t2\\t\\nand Scope 3 (business air travel and \\noutsourced currency operations) emissions reduction;\\n•\\t2030\\t targets\\tfor\\tenergy\\tand\\twater\\t\\nefficiency, as well as waste disposal, in line with GreenGov.SG's targets;\\n•\\t2030\\t target\\tfor\\temissions\\t intensity \\t\\nreduction in the investment portfolio; and\\n•\\tExpanded\\t analysis\\t of\\tWeighted \\t\\nAverage Carbon Intensity (WACI) of investment portfolio.  \\n  \\nWard still, and onward \\nWe need to build on the progress that MAS and the financial sector have achieved so far, and continue to “ward still, and onward”.  \\nFirst, in view of Singapore’s recent \\nnational commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century, MAS will strive towards setting a net-zero emissions target for our physical operations at the earliest possible timeframe.

Singapore has likewise ratcheted up our climate ambition, announcing in February 2022, our target to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century.\\nAsia is key to the world’s transition \\nto net-zero. The region accounts for about half of global carbon emissions, and more than half of global energy consumption. Asia must find ways to transition towards greater sustainability, while securing economic and social development for its people. Transition should be implemented in a just and orderly manner, even as net-zero commitments need to be backed by credible transition pathways. \\nSustainable finance can be a powerful \\nenabler for an effective yet inclusive transition to net-zero. Financial institutions (FIs) play an influential role in promoting sustainability and combating climate change, by directing capital to sustainable projects, as well as through active engagement to influence changes in their clients’ businesses. For marginally bankable but worthy green projects, or in areas where the size of funding is immense, public-private partnerships play an important role in de-risking and crowding in more private sector financing. \\nMAS is doing its part in the fight \\nagainst climate change. MAS seeks to promote sustained non-inflationary economic growth, and a sound and progressive financial centre which supports and fosters financial inclusion.  Environmental and climate considerations are integrated across MAS’ core functions:\\n•\\tAs\\ta\\tcentral\\t bank\\tand\\tfinancial \\t\\nregulator, MAS works with \\nfinancial institutions to strengthen the Singapore financial sector’s resilience to environmental risks.\\n•\\tAs\\ta\\tpromoter \\tof\\tSingapore\\t as\\tan\\t\\ninternational financial centre, we work with financial institutions to develop a vibrant sustainable finance ecosystem to support Asia’s transition to a low-carbon future. \\n•\\tAs\\tthe\\tguardian\\t of\\tSingapore’s \\t\\nofficial foreign reserves, MAS integrates climate risks and opportunities into our investment framework.\\n•\\tAs\\tan\\torganisation,\\t MAS\\tseeks\\t\\nto reduce its own carbon and environmental footprint to support Singapore’s broader climate ambitions and commitments. \\nMAS has been taking progressive steps to implement the Green Finance Action Plan (GFAP) introduced in 2019, to build resilience against climate and environmental risks and support a sustainable Singapore and facilitate Asia’s transition to a sustainable future. It complements the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and lays out MAS’ sustainable finance strategy across five thrusts (details in infographic). MAS works closely with other government agencies on climate change and sustainability, in particular on international Green Economy Agreements and other efforts to enable the growth of Singapore’s green economy.  \\nExecutive summary\\nEnhance \\ncomparability and reliability of sustainability-related disclosuresStrengthen the financial\\tsector’s \\t\\nresilience to environmental risks\\nDevelop green and\\ttransition \\t\\nfinance\\tsolutions \\t\\nand markets for a sustainable economy\\nHarness technology to enable trusted and\\tefficient \\t\\nsustainable finance\\tflows\\nBuild knowledge and\\tcapabilities \\t\\nin sustainable financeGreen Finance \\naction PlanStrengthening alignment of MAS’ \\nSustainability Report with the \\nTask Force on Climate-Related \\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines\\nMAS published its first Sustainability \\nReport in June 2021, detailing our efforts to strengthen the resilience of our financial sector to environmental risks, develop a vibrant sustainable finance ecosystem, build a climate-resilient investment portfolio, and incorporate sustainable practices in our organisation. \\nMAS advocates early implementation of \\nsustainability reporting for the financial sector.

Prior to tabling at the GFSC, relevant initiatives to build a climate-resilient financial sector are deliberated at the Management Financial Supervision Committee (MFSC) which is chaired by MAS’ Deputy Managing Director (Financial Supervision) or Management Financial Stability Committee (FSC) which is chaired by MAS’ Managing Director. The MFSC convenes on a weekly basis to decide on matters relating to the supervision and regulation of the financial services sector, such as legislative frameworks and supervisory policies. The FSC convenes on a quarterly basis and is a platform to identify and assess risks to the financial Governance\\nsystem, discuss macroprudential and financial stability issues of concern, and formulate macroprudential policy.\\nIn addition, MAS consults and works \\nclosely with the industry on our initiatives. In 2019, the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT) was convened by MAS, comprising representatives from financial institutions, corporates, non-governmental organisations and financial industry associations. GFIT seeks to accelerate the development of sustainable finance through four key thrusts: (i) developing a taxonomy; (ii) improving disclosures; (iii) fostering green finance solutions; and (iv) enhancing environmental risk management practices of financial institutions. GFIT will also support sustainable finance capacity building among banks, insurers, asset managers and corporates.Overview\\nStrengthening financial sector resilience to environmental risks\\nThe financial sector is exposed to \\nenvironmental and climate-related risks through its financing, insurance, and investment activities. Physical risks manifesting as acute weather events or chronic environmental changes can damage property, disrupt supply chains, and displace populations. These events can reduce asset values of investments or collaterals, result in lower profitability for companies, and increase the cost of underwriting losses for insurers. \\nMeanwhile, the transition to a low-\\ncarbon economy can also pose risks to the financial system, as institutions can suffer from sudden write-downs in asset values induced by policy changes, technological advancements, as well as shifts in investor preferences and social norms. As Singapore’s integrated financial regulator, MAS is committed to play a leading role to bolster the financial sector’s resilience to environmental risks.\\nMAS has progressively integrated \\nenvironmental risk into its supervisory framework and processes at both the individual firm and system-wide levels. MAS will continue its efforts to (1) uplift environmental risk management practices of financial institutions through ongoing supervision and industry partnership, (2) deepen climate risk assessment capabilities through climate scenario analysis, and (3) enhance environmental and climate-related disclosure standards to promote market transparency. \\ninternational c ollaboration\\nCoordinated action by regulators and \\ncentral banks globally is necessary to facilitate a common understanding of the pertinent challenges and set meaningful goals that consider a country or region’s particular constraints. Such clarity will allow for more effective mobilisation of capital for low-carbon and sustainable investments. With data gaps still present and climate risk frameworks still evolving, international collaboration remains critical to facilitate the sharing of best practices as they emerge and promote globally compatible frameworks.\\nMAS actively contributes to global \\nefforts on sustainable finance through our participation in, and leadership of, international committees and multilateral and regional platforms including the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), and Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF). We work closely with our global counterparts to build alignment and advance global standards, encourage consistency in supervisory and regulatory approaches and minimise market fragmentation. \\nTaking on leadership roles in \\ninternational committees amplifies MAS’ ability to contribute and shape global best practices, regulatory and supervisory approaches to sustainability issues.

The Guidelines set out MAS’ supervisory expectations on the effective governance, robust risk management and meaningful disclosure of environmental-related risks. MAS actively engages financial institutions on their progress towards adhering to the Guidelines. MAS also partners GFIT to collectively uplift industry practices in environmental risk management. \\nDeepen climate risk assessment \\ncapabilities through climate \\nscenario analysis\\nClimate-related events and their \\nassociated risks are subject to significant uncertainty in terms of their timing, frequency, or severity. Given these uncertainties, stress testing and scenario analysis are useful tools for assessing the potential impact of climate risks on financial institutions and the broader economy. MAS continues to encourage the development of climate-related risk assessment capabilities by featuring thematic climate scenarios in the Industry-Wide Stress Test. Given the nascent stage of research in quantifying climate risks, MAS’ work on climate stress testing and climate-related modelling will involve a multi-year iterative process in partnership with industry.\\nEnhance comparability and \\nreliability of sustainability-related \\ndisclosuresHaving consistent, comparable and \\nreliable disclosures from corporates will allow financial institutions to better understand and assess the impact of environmental and climate-related risks, on their underwriting and asset portfolios. MAS continues to take steps to enhance environmental and climate-related disclosure standards to promote market transparency and facilitate the reallocation of capital toward sustainable outcomes. Given the interconnected nature of the global financial system, it is not practical or effective to improve corporate sustainability-related disclosures in isolation. It is of paramount importance that Singaporean corporates and financial institutions align their sustainability reporting practices with recognised international frameworks and standards, such as the TCFD recommendations and the upcoming International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards, to ensure comparable and consistent disclosures globally. To this end, MAS will consult on introducing mandatory disclosure requirements for financial institutions, as soon as a global baseline sustainability reporting standard is established by the ISSB, as expected by the end of this year. MAS also works with international organisations like the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to enhance the quality of sustainability-related disclosures for securities issuers worldwide. \\nCollaborate actively with other \\nsupervisors and central banks\\nnetwork for Greening the Financial \\nSystem (nGFS)\\nMAS Managing Director, Mr Ravi \\nMenon, was appointed as the Chair of the NGFS for a two-year term starting in January 2022.

To this end, MAS has (1) conducted thematic reviews and published information papers on FIs’ environmental risk management practices, and (2) encouraged the development of climate risk assessment capabilities through the Industry-Wide Stress Test. \\nGreenwashing can occur at the firm \\nlevel and product level. From the market conduct angle, MAS recognises that greenwashing is a significant risk arising from the overstatement or lack of clarity about a firm’s sustainability commitments, or lack of alignment between the product’s sustainability-related name and its investment objective. \\nTo mitigate risk of greenwashing, MAS \\nhas promoted the adoption of globally consistent, comparable and reliable sustainability disclosures by working with international and domestic organisations.\\nSupervisory engagements \\ninformation Papers on e nvironmental \\nrisk Management for Banks, i nsurers \\nand asset ManagersRisks from climate change and environmental degradation can translate into financial and non-financial risks to FIs. It is crucial for FIs to build resilience to these risks by integrating environmental risk into their business strategies and risk management frameworks. To do this well, FIs would need to have effective board and senior management oversight of environmental risks, and robust risk management policies and processes to assess, mitigate and monitor their risk exposures. \\nMAS set out its supervisory expectations \\naround effective governance, robust risk management and meaningful disclosure of environmental-related risks through issuance of the Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management to FIs (ENRM Guidelines) in December 2020.\\nAhead of the ENRM Guidelines effective \\ndate in June 2022, MAS conducted thematic reviews of FIs’ environmental risk management practices in 2021 to take stock of implementation progress. MAS engaged selected banks, insurers, and asset managers through surveys and dialogue sessions with the FIs. While progress has been made overall, the surveyed FIs were at differing levels of sophistication.\\nIn May 2022, to accelerate FIs’ adoption \\nof the ENRM Guidelines and uplift industry standards, MAS published information papers on the environmental risk practices of banks, insurers, and asset managers. The papers provide an overview of the progress made by Risk Managementselected FIs in implementing the ENRM Guidelines. The papers also highlight emerging and/or good practices by FIs and identify areas where further work is needed.\\nWork is ongoing to address the \\nimplementation challenges that FIs have highlighted, such as:\\n•\\tTo\\tprovide\\t a\\tbaseline\\t to\\tguide\\t\\nFIs’ client-level risk assessment \\non environmental risks, MAS collaborated with the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT) and Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) to develop a standardised Environmental Risk Questionnaire for FIs to obtain common key risk data from clients in a way that is comparable across clients and fit-for-purpose to facilitate financing decisions. This also helps to establish a best practice for banks in Singapore to engage their clients in assessment and mitigation of their environmental risks.

It will help stakeholders to allocate capital efficiently towards climate change mitigation and adaptation, thereby enhancing the financial sector’s resilience. MAS continues to advance our vision of globally consistent, comparable and reliable sustainability disclosures by working with both international and domestic organisations. MAS supports the alignment of disclosures with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and recognised international standards such as the upcoming International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards. \\nSince June 2021, there have been \\nsignificant developments in this area. Specifically, along with the set-up of the ISSB by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, the IFRS Technical Readiness Working Group (TRWG) published the Climate-Related Disclosures Prototype in November 2021. The ISSB issued exposure drafts for its general requirements and climate disclosure standards for consultation on 31 March 2022, and targets to finalise its standards by end 2022.\\nThe ISSB standards – which build on \\nthe TCFD recommendations, among others, – is expected to form the global baseline reporting standards for sustainability\\n5. MAS co-led a \\nTechnical Expert Group (TEG) under the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Sustainable Finance Task Force (STF) to provide recommendations to the IFRS Foundation, with a view towards potentially endorsing future ISSB standards for use by IOSCO member jurisdictions. MAS actively participates in the Technical Review Coordination Group (TRC) which continues the TEG’s work, and leads the review of climate disclosure standards. The TRC is reviewing the exposure draft disclosure standards published by the ISSB on 31 March 2022 to assess if they meet IOSCO’s expectations for endorsement. The TRC will provide comments on the draft as the ISSB looks to finalise its disclosure standards by end 2022. \\nMAS also worked on three IOSCO \\nSTF reports published in 2021 on sustainability-related issuer disclosures, improving sustainability-related practices of asset managers, and understanding the increasingly important role of ESG ratings and data providers. The reports include recommendations for regulators and policymakers to supervise and improve policies, practices, disclosures, as well as address risks of greenwashing.\\nMandatory d isclosures for listed \\ncompanies\\nMAS\\tworked\\t with\\tSGX\\tto\\tfinalise\\t its\\t\\nroadmap on mandatory climate-related \\nfinancial disclosures, consistent with recommendations of the TCFD.

To enable companies to invest in sustainable projects and assets, and adopt sustainable business practices, MAS has introduced grant schemes to defray the costs of issuing green and sustainability-linked bonds and loans that meet international standards. MAS also partners the private sector and multilateral development banks to catalyse financing solutions for longer-term and marginally bankable sustainable projects. \\nMAS is keen to expand the sustainable \\nfinance ecosystem, covering financial institutions, ancillary service providers, academia, standard setting bodies and international organisations in Singapore. These stakeholders will catalyse the co-creation of innovative financing solutions, raise competencies, and enhance corporates’ adoption of sustainability practices. To mitigate risks of greenwashing, the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT), is developing a taxonomy that will define green and transition activities for Singapore-based financial institutions.\\nMAS is working with the public \\nand private sector to support the development of a trusted and robust voluntary carbon market.

The grant sought to support the issuance of green bonds in Singapore, by defraying the additional costs of verifying green, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds as compared to conventional bonds while promoting the adoption of internally accepted standards. MAS’ Green and Sustainability-Linked Loan Grant Scheme (GSLS) was launched in November 2020 to encourage businesses to take up green and sustainability-linked loans. The grant defrays the expenses of engaging independent service providers to validate the green and sustainability credentials of the loan. The grant also encourages banks to develop green and sustainability-linked loan frameworks to make such financing more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).Strategy\\ninitiatives. In 2019, the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT) was convened by MAS and comprises representatives from financial institutions, corporates, non-governmental organisations and financial industry associations. The Taskforce seeks to accelerate the development of sustainable finance through four key initiatives: (i) develop a taxonomy; (ii) improve disclosures; (iii) foster green finance solutions; and (iv) enhance environmental risk management practices of financial institutions.

This involves the setting of robust interim targets, as backloading needed measures in the later years increase the risks of missing the net-zero goals. MAS is engaging key international organisations such as the Glasgow Risk Management\\nFinancial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) that are developing decarbonisation pathways backed by science for the financial and real economy sectors. These organisations will work closely with financial institutions in Singapore and the region to support their net-zero and decarbonisation efforts. \\nMAS also recognises the need to guard \\nagainst the risk of greenwashing given increasing inflows into sustainable products and funds.  Greenwashing can occur at the firm level and product comprising agriculture and forestry/land use, real estate, transportation, energy, and industrial, which account for 90% of ASEAN GHG emissions and 40% of economic value add, and three enabling sectors comprising information and communications technology, waste/circular economy, and carbon capture and sequestration, whose products and services contribute to the environmental objectives. The GFIT launched a second public consultation in May 2022, which laid out a guiding framework to define green and transition activities and the technical screening criteria in the three core sectors – energy, buildings and construction, transportation and fuels. Thresholds for the remaining five sectors will be detailed in a subsequent public consultation. The May 2022 public consultation also incorporates a user guide for financial institutions and companies to apply the taxonomy.\\naSean taxonomy Board (atB)\\nIn March 2021, the 7th ASEAN Finance \\nMinisters and Central Bank Governors Meeting (AFMGM) endorsed the development of a multi-tier ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, to serve as an overarching guide for all ASEAN Member States (AMS), complementing their respective national sustainability initiatives and serving as ASEAN’s common language for sustainable finance. The ASEAN Taxonomy Board (hosted by Sustainable \\nFinance Institute Asia) was established \\nin March 2021 to undertake the taxonomy development.\\nThe ASEAN Taxonomy comprises \\ntwo tiers, (i) the principles-based Foundation Framework which provides baseline guidance to determine if activities contribute to the Taxonomy’s environmental objectives, and (ii) the level, such as  the overstatement or lack of clarity about a firm’s sustainability commitments, or lack of alignment between the product’s stated sustainability objective versus its actual investment allocations. \\nMAS seeks to mitigate greenwashing \\nin the financial system through the following enablers, (i) taxonomies to serve as an established, science-based and common reference for financial institutions to determine if an economic activity is green or transition, by enabling activities to be evaluated against specific criteria; (ii) consistent disclosures to ensure that financial institutions and corporates report the activities conducted and the extent of greenness, and in certain jurisdictions, referencing the taxonomy; and (iii) leveraging technology to obtain real-time data to facilitate timely evaluation of the greenness of companies and activities, and verifying compliance with international standards. MAS’ efforts on disclosures are detailed in the “A Climate-Resilient Financial Sector” section of the Sustainability Report. \\nInteroperability across different \\ntaxonomies\\nTo unlock sustainable finance, we need \\ncommon definitions for activities that contribute to climate goals. Taxonomies are emerging as a key tool for unlocking green and sustainable finance. By providing clarity to the market on what activities can be considered green or sustainable, taxonomies facilitate the scaling up of green finance. \\nIn January 2021, the Green Finance \\nIndustry Taskforce (GFIT) issued a Phase 1 taxonomy for public consultation.

These principles provide guidance on  preserving  the integrity of the product by capturing the fundamental characteristics common to each type of ESG product. This includes guidance on the use-of-proceeds of capital raised, level of ambition for target setting, reporting frequency, and external verification. The principles allow for standardisation in the market on what constitutes a green, social, sustainable, or sustainability-linked bond or loan, which in turn discourages the origination or issuance of falsely categorised products that fall short of the guidelines.  \\nTo verify that grant scheme applicants \\nadhere to these principles, applicants must obtain external verification of the alignment to relevant principles prior to the inception of the product. For Sustainability-linked instruments with defined Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) or targeted ESG ratings scores, applicants are required to seek external verification of their progress towards the fulfilment of the SPTs or attainment of higher ESG ratings on an annual basis.

These cumulatively account for 96% of our total emissions in FY2021. We have reduced Scope 2 emissions by 23% from its peak in 2013 and it has since been on a downward trajectory. \\nMAS has launched a 2030 environmental \\nsustainability roadmap that sets out our Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 (business air travel and outsourced currency operations) near-term emissions Strategy\\nreduction targets and strategies. We aim to achieve these near-term targets in FY2025 and FY2030 through evaluating the potential for reducing the major components of our carbon footprint, choosing the best approaches through cost-benefit analyses, and assessing the potential use of carbon offsets for emissions that are difficult to abate. \\nOur 2030 roadmap builds on our ongoing \\nefforts since 2013 to deploy energy efficiency measures such as central air conditioning, heat recovery system, and lighting systems in MAS Building, to keep pace with technological advancements. We also introduced NEWater in our overall water reticulation system, which provides water to our air-con cooling system. This reduced the need to use potable water. Through these strategies, MAS has maintained the GreenMark certification (Platinum) since 2015, and was awarded the Energy Efficiency National Partnership (EENP) Award in 2018.\\nReduce scope 2 electricity \\nemissions\\nMeasures to reduce electricity \\nemissions in MAS’ premises include:\\n•\\tUsing\\t cool\\tpaint\\tto\\tlower\\tthe\\t\\ntemperature of our water storage \\ntanks, \\n•\\tRaising\\t indoor\\tair-conditioned \\t\\ntemperature to 25°C, \\n•\\tUsing\\t more\\tenergy\\tefficient,\\t motion-\\ncontrolled LED lightings in our office premises, \\n•\\tInstalling\\t solar\\tpanels\\ton\\tthe\\trooftop\\t\\nof MAS Building and Currency House, and \\n•\\tReplacing\\t the\\tcentral\\tair\\tconditioning \\t\\nsystem at Currency House.\\nReduce scope 3 business air \\ntravel emissions\\nNew norms for international meetings \\npresent an opportunity to reduce the air travel of MAS staff. Many international engagements, such as meetings, conferences, courses and workshops, were held virtually during the CO vID-19 \\npandemic. As air travel normalises, we can expect some meetings to return to an in-person format. Others may continue in an exclusively virtual setting, while some organisers may choose to adopt a hybrid meeting format. MAS introduced a carbon budget framework and issued guidelines on delegation sizes to work towards meeting our target for business air travel emissions reduction.\\nReduce scope 3 outsourced \\ncurrency emissions\\nMAS’ currency value chain comprises \\noutsourced currency operations, in-house currency processing and waste incineration\\n12. The outsourced currency \\noperations include currency production, processing and transportation. The reduction of carbon emissions from MAS’ outsourced currency operations hinges on a lowering in the public demand for notes and coins, given MAS’ mandate to meet the demand. Nonetheless, MAS seeks to reduce the carbon footprint of our outsourced currency operations where we are able to, across the currency value chain – both upstream and downstream.\\nUpstream:•\\tIn\\tcurrency \\tproduction,\\t we\\tare\\t\\nworking with our current polymer \\nnote printer, Note Printing Australia (NPA), to reduce carbon emissions from the production of our notes.

This wastes resources, resulting in unwarranted carbon emissions.\\n•\\tMAS\\taims\\tto\\tshift\\tpublic\\tpreferences \\t\\nby encouraging the use of fit notes during festive gifting and continuing with the progressive reduction of new notes to reduce the environmental impact of new notes issuance.

MAS continues to actively encourage the three ‘R’s of reduce, reuse and recycle amongst staff, to minimise waste, conserve natural resources and reduce carbon emissions. \\nDevelop a culture of sustainability \\nMAS recognises the importance of building a culture of sustainability and encourages staff to actively adopt sustainability-friendly practices through the three ‘A’s of Awareness, Advocacy and Action. MAS actively encourages staff to develop and deepen their understanding of sustainability issues through webinars, learning events and brownbag sessions. This year, sustainability was a key theme in our annual staff seminar, One MAS Connect (OMC), where officers from various departments spoke about their work in sustainability and other ground-up activities in the organisation. We also launched our inaugural sustainability sentiment survey in 2022 to understand staff’s attitudes, willingness and perceptions towards building a culture of sustainability within MAS.\\nThe MAS Recreation Club formed a \\nSustainability Committee to implement ground-up initiatives and actionable interventions. These aim to change the behaviours and attitudes of staff towards waste generation or resource usage in the office. Initiatives such as plastic free days and reusable bag sharing points will be piloted to encourage staff to adopt environmentally friendly habits.A Sustainable \\nOrganisation•\\tStrategy\\n13  The use of e-Payments such as PayNow, FAST and SGQR are convenient alternatives to cash and cheques.

Several mitigating measures have been incorporated in the design of the building, including the placement of key critical equipment above ground level, having elevated building entrances, and implementing a water alert system in the basement carpark.     \\nAt the national level, PUB, our national \\nwater agency, has installed more than 300 water level sensors around Singapore for the monitoring of drainage systems, and has a SMS alert system in place, to facilitate timely updates to the public on potential flash floods.\\nManagement of outsourced  \\ncurrency operationsMAS’ outsourced currency operations \\nare exposed to both physical and transition risks arising from climate change. MAS has taken measures to mitigate and reduce the risks.Risk Management\\nPhysical risk arising from extreme weather conditions may result in production or delivery delays.

The open-tender procurement approach for currency replenishment allows us to award to a vendor that meets our requirements and provides the most value-for-money bid. As our vendor transits towards less polluting and greener operations, this may result in higher production and operation costs due to factors such as policy constraints on emissions in the vendor’s country of operation, higher carbon taxes imposed, and market changes. As such, it is important for us to lower our carbon footprint and progressively introduce measures to reduce public demand for new currency notes and coins. \\nFactoring climate-related \\nconsiderations in procurement\\nMAS has factored climate-related \\nconsiderations in our procurement processes.

IT risk assessment helps to determine the vulnerabilities in information systems \\nand the broader IT environment, assess the likelihood that a risky event will occur, \\nand rank risks based on the risk estimate combined with the level of impact that it \\nwould cause if it occurs.
